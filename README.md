# CSRD-dataset-generator
 Generate a CSRD dataset based on CSRD and S&K criteria. The data is from Factset.

To ensure that the script runs smoothly, include the data files to be used in a subfolder called "Factset data". Other subfolders / locations can also be used, but require the script to be modified.
